Question: How do you manage different environments (e.g., Dev, QA, Staging, Production) in your application deployment pipeline?
Answer: I manage environments using Terraform with separate workspace states for each environment. Our organization structure includes `/terraform` directories with environment-specific `.tfvars` files (dev.tfvars, staging.tfvars, prod.tfvars). Each environment has dedicated EKS clusters provisioned through Terraform. For application deployments, we use ArgoCD with environment-specific application manifests in Git repositories. GitHub Actions workflows trigger the appropriate Terraform workspace based on branch patterns. We maintain separate AWS accounts for production versus non-production environments for strong isolation, with Terraform managing cross-account access where needed.

Question: How do you ensure that configurations are appropriately handled across these environments?
Answer: We use a combination of Terraform variables and Kubernetes ConfigMaps/Secrets. Each environment has dedicated `.tfvars` files that define environment-specific infrastructure parameters. For Kubernetes configurations, we maintain base Helm charts with environment-specific values files in our GitOps repository. Sensitive configurations are stored in HashiCorp Vault and injected during deployment using the Vault Kubernetes integration. Our GitHub Actions validates configuration syntax before applying, and ArgoCD ensures deployed configurations match the desired state in Git. We also use Terraform outputs to expose infrastructure values that applications need, which ArgoCD consumes during deployments.

Question: What strategies do you use to promote code from one environment to another?
Answer: We follow a Git branching strategy where `feature/*` branches are deployed to dev, `develop` branch deploys to staging, and `main` branch deploys to production. Our GitHub Actions workflows are triggered based on these branch patterns. For application promotion, all builds create immutable container images tagged with Git SHA, which are promoted across environments rather than rebuilding. ArgoCD is configured with environment-specific application sets that deploy these images based on environment variables defined in overlays. Required approvals are configured in GitHub for merges to protected branches, and ArgoCD sync requires manual approval for production deployments through RBAC policies.

Question: How do you ensure rollback in case of deployment failure?
Answer: For infrastructure managed by Terraform, we maintain state history and version control, allowing us to revert to previous commits and apply. For Kubernetes applications, ArgoCD maintains a history of successful deployments with their manifests. We implement automated health checks that ArgoCD uses to determine deployment success. If failures occur, we can either use ArgoCD's rollback feature to revert to the previous successful deployment or trigger a GitHub Actions workflow to apply a previous infrastructure state. Our CI process tags all images with Git SHAs, making it trivial to redeploy a specific known-good version. For database changes, we use migrations that support rollback operations and maintain backward compatibility across adjacent versions.

Question: How do you handle infrastructure provisioning across different environments?
Answer: I structure Terraform code with a modular approach where `/modules` contains reusable infrastructure components and environment-specific configurations come from `environments/[env].tfvars` files. GitHub Actions workflows select the appropriate workspace and variables file based on the Git branch. For EKS clusters, I use Terraform to provision the base infrastructure and node groups, with environment-specific sizing (e.g., smaller instances for dev, larger for production). ArgoCD is installed into each cluster with environment-specific configurations. For development, we use Terraform's auto-destroy capability with a time-based schedule variable in the dev.tfvars to reduce costs during off-hours, while production remains permanently provisioned.

Question: How do you manage secrets and environment-specific configurations securely?
Answer: We use a dual approach with HashiCorp Vault for application secrets and AWS Secrets Manager for infrastructure secrets. Vault is deployed in each EKS cluster with authentication tied to Kubernetes service accounts. Sensitive Terraform variables are stored in AWS Secrets Manager and accessed via the AWS provider. GitHub Actions uses OIDC authentication to obtain temporary AWS credentials, avoiding stored secrets. For application secrets, the Vault Kubernetes integration injects secrets at runtime, and Vault's dynamic secrets capability automatically rotates database credentials. Environment-specific configurations are managed in ArgoCD with Kustomize overlays for each environment, while Vault policies enforce environment isolation for secrets access.

Question: What deployment strategies have you used (e.g., Blue-Green, Canary, Rolling updates)?
Answer: In our EKS environments managed by ArgoCD, I primarily implement Rolling updates for stateless applications using Kubernetes Deployments with appropriate health checks and readiness probes. For critical services, I've implemented Blue-Green deployments using Kubernetes Services with selectors that switch between two deployment sets after health validation. For high-traffic services, we use Canary deployments with traffic splitting managed by AWS ALB Ingress Controller, starting with 5% traffic to the new version and gradually increasing based on error rates and latency metrics from CloudWatch. ArgoCD's progressive sync features help automate these strategies with automatic rollback if health checks fail during deployment.

Question: What types of testing do you include in your CI/CD pipeline, and at what stages do they run?
Answer: Our GitHub Actions workflow includes multiple testing stages. Unit tests run on every commit using language-specific frameworks with coverage enforcement. After building container images, we conduct security scanning with Trivy. For deployments to dev, our pipeline runs integration tests against the deployed APIs. Terraform plan validation runs before any infrastructure changes are applied. In staging, we execute end-to-end tests with Cypress and performance tests using k6. Post-deployment smoke tests verify core functionality in every environment. Each test stage is a required check in GitHub pull requests, and failures block promotion to higher environments. ArgoCD's health checks provide an additional validation layer after deployment.

Question: How do you automate unit, integration, and end-to-end tests in your pipeline?
Answer: Our GitHub Actions workflows automate all testing. Unit tests run in the build stage, triggered on every push, using workspace-mounted volumes for test reports and coverage data. Integration tests run after deploying to the dev EKS cluster, with GitHub Actions having OIDC-based access to invoke tests against deployed endpoints. End-to-end tests using Cypress run in dedicated GitHub Actions runners with browser capabilities, targeting staging environments after deployment. Test results and artifacts are uploaded to GitHub Actions artifacts for review. ArgoCD deployments include readiness gates that verify system health before completing the deployment. Failed tests in GitHub Actions automatically create issues for developers to address, with links to the specific runs and logs.

Question: How do you ensure integration tests work across different environments?
Answer: We structure integration tests to read configuration from environment variables injected by GitHub Actions workflows. Each test job in the workflow pulls environment-specific endpoints from Terraform outputs and EKS service discovery. Test data is managed through Kubernetes Jobs that seed test fixtures before test execution. For external dependencies, we use Wiremock containers deployed alongside the application in test environments to provide consistent responses. Database tests run against environment-specific databases provisioned by Terraform, using migrations to ensure schema compatibility. After tests complete, cleanup jobs remove test data. ArgoCD ensures consistent application state across environments, making integration tests reliable across the pipeline.

Question: How do you ensure deployments are successful, and what monitoring/logging tools do you use to detect failures?
Answer: Our deployment success validation is multi-layered. ArgoCD monitors Kubernetes resources for healthy state after applying manifests. We implement Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes that validate both infrastructure and application health. For monitoring, we use Prometheus deployed on EKS with Grafana dashboards displaying key metrics. Logs are centralized in CloudWatch and processed with CloudWatch Insights. Both the application and infrastructure expose custom metrics for business and technical KPIs. Alerting is configured in Prometheus Alertmanager with PagerDuty integration for critical issues. Post-deployment, automated Kubernetes Jobs run synthetic transactions to verify end-to-end functionality. If any check fails, ArgoCD automatically initiates a rollback to the previous known-good state.
